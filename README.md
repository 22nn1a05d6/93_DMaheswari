Problem Statement:
In Physical clothing store, long fitting wait times, limited Size, color availability and difficulty visualizing outfits lead to wasted time, poor shopping experiences, and reduced customer satisfaction.
To Address these challenges, and AI-powered Intelligent system is needed to enhance the in-store fitting experience through Virtual Try-ons, personalized recommendations and real-time assistance. 

Proposed Solution:
To overcome the challenges of long fitting room wait times, limited size and color availability, and difficulty in visualizing outfits, an AI-powered intelligent fitting system can be introduced in physical clothing stores. This system uses computer vision and machine learning to enable real-time virtual try-ons through smart mirrors or camera-based displays, allowing customers to visualize how different garments, sizes, and colors look on them without physically changing clothes. By integrating body pose estimation and garment overlay techniques, the system provides accurate fitting visualization, while AI-driven recommendation models suggest suitable styles, sizes, and combinations based on customer preferences and body features. Additionally, real-time assistance such as size availability alerts and styling suggestions enhances decision-making, reduces waiting time, improves customer satisfaction, and creates a more engaging and efficient in-store shopping experience.
